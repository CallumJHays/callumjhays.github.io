Recently I came across Python's `Annotated` type while [migrating the `typing_extensions` library to micropython](https://github.com/micropython/micropython-lib/issues/190#issuecomment-751616492). After some brief googling there didn't appear to be much info in the community on how to use it, so I decided to write this post.

The `Annotated` type is the main focus of [PEP 539](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0593/) released with the standard `typing` module in Python >= 3.9 or with the `typing_extensions` library in previous versions.

In its basic form, `Annotated` lets you pack arbitrary python objects as a tuple in a `__metadata__` attribute of a type object:

```python
from typing_extensions import Annotated

SpecialInt = Annotated[int, "str Annotation", 42, {'hello': 'world'}]

print(SpecialInt.__metadata__)
# ('str Annotation', 42, {'hello': 'world'})
```

> PS: Usually `__attr__`s are better not accessed directly; there's
> generally a stdlib function that should be used instead (such as
> `setattr()`). However I haven't been able to find one for `__metadata__` (¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯)

One of the best use-cases of `Annotated` I can think of is data validation for function inputs. Note there's a bit of code required for the examples below to work.

You can get the [full working code here](https://gist.github.com/CallumJHays/e4ad98925894a8e1cd7ef57e90fe2807/).

```python
from typing_extensions import Annotated as An
from runtype_validation import validate, InRange

@validate
def test_fn(a: An[int, InRange(0, 100)],
            b: An[float, InRange(0, 1)]):
    pass

test_fn(50, 0.5) # works

test_fn(0.5, 0.5)
# TypeError: Expected a to have type <class 'int'> but got <class 'float'>

test_fn(b=2, a=50)
# AssertionError: Argument b=2 not in range [0, 1)
```

This works for class methods as well:

```python
class Test:
    @validate
    def __init__(self,
                 a: An[int, InRange(0, 100)],
                 b: An[float, InRange(0, 1)]):
        pass
```

One can also extend it as a class decorator, applying the `@validate` each method of the class:

```python
# equivalent to previous example

@validate
class Test:
    def __init__(...etc): ...
```

`typing.Annotated` is a very powerful and flexible tool when properly understood. If you have any other ideas for how to use `Annotated`, I'd love to hear about it in the comments below!
